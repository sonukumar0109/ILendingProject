Project Introduction: Lending Management System

The Lending Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of lending and borrowing. This project is developed using Java (JSP and Servlet technologies), Spring Framework, and Hibernate ORM for backend logic and database interaction, with JavaScript used to enhance the user interface and interactivity.

This system allows users to register, apply for loans, view their loan status, and manage repayments. Admins can approve or reject loan applications, track payments, and manage user data. The architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for clear separation of concerns, improving maintainability and scalability.
